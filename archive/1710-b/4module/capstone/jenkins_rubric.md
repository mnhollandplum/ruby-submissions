## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### 1. Project Planning & Management

Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)

- Meets Expectations

* I actually did make updates to my waffle tracking board. Once I completed a feature, I would return to waffle to add more cards for my next feature. I also made a backend waffle board to track what I needed to do on that side. 

### 2. Completion & Pace

Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way. Developer communicates adjustments to Technical Lead as soon as possible (if necessary).

- Meets Expectations

* I met with my tech lead regularly and discussed isses and ideas to get through my problems. I planned my stories before I implemented and that seemed to help me stay organized. 

### 3. Implementation Quality

Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions and best practices.

- Meets Expectations

* Backend has some tests.. could use some more. Front-end code is organized in a way that makes sense to me and uses logical naming conventions. I feel like I used ES6 well and only used ES5 for google sign in and when using "this". 

### 4. Application of Techniques

Developer implements four new techniques or patterns.

- Meets Expectations

*I used JavaScript, jQuery, OAuth with Google using JavaScript front-end, spoonacular API, and deployed front-end using a new service-- Surge

### 5. Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.

- Above Expectations

*Readme's are complete for both front-end and back-end applications. Setup is clear instructions along with deployed app links. 

### 6. Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.

- Meets/Below Expectations

*I did run axe to assist with accessability fixes and fixed what I could however there is a label issue with my form that I was unable to resolve. I don't really know what the issue is as it was not explained well in axe and google did not return any helpful hints. Referred to previous project and didn't notice any differences in what I had.
