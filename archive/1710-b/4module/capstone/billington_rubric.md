## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### 1. Project Planning & Management

Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)
I feel I did an excellent job at planning and sticking to plans. I feel that my partner would seemingly agree to Pivotal card tasks, design, or verbal communincation with the client, and then would totally do his own thing.

### 2. Completion & Pace

Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes ustments along the way. Developer communicates adjustments to Technical Lead as soon as possible (if necessary).some scope adj
I was active in communicating with our client.  I put a lot of effort into taking notes and breaking tasks down into Pivotal cards, but my partner took off and "started" tasks that left the majority of cards started but unfinished. In my personal pursuit of the project, I made small tasks and completed functionality in an orderly way.

### 3. Implementation Quality

Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions and best practices.
In taking on the project separately in the last 4 days, I have focused more on redesigning the database structure and page styling to meet client's current and future needs. I am proud of the database design and connections, as well as the ways I used JS with Rails to minimize confusion with UX while also targeting use for mobile devices. Testing was not a priority, but I will be completing a test suite after graduation as I continue to work with the client.

There are few AXE violations. The majority are contrast violations where the text is a little too light. This will be easy to solve. :)
