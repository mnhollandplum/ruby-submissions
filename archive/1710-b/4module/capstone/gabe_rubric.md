### Project Template

### GOAT Reviews üêê

### Pitch

This application would provide a sort of social media platform for fans of HipHop and eventually all music fans to communicate
and share their opinions. Starting with HipHop since the younger generation tends to gravitate towards it more, opening the door
for more potential users. Eventually would expand to all styles of music.


### Problem


There's no real platform for music nerds to nerd out on music and share opinions. Sure there's the Youtube comment section
but it's not a true platform


### Solution

Bringing people together through this application and their spotify accounts to interact more closely with eachother

### MVP

What is your MVP? Be very specific about what pieces of functionality will be in place.

* Must have MVP:
  
  Users can log in
  Users can search for artists by name
  Users can see general artist information provided by an API
  Users can access and stream Music from that artist
  User can write reviews on the albums streamed

* Hope to reach (beyond my initial MVP):

  Spotify Oauth
  Dashboard Analytics
  Users can share data with eachother, communicate more closely

### Target Audience

Music Nerds, Music bloggers etc

### New Technologies

JavaScript
React.js
Spotify API(stretch goal)
FindRap API
JWT

### User Stories

You must have at least 5 of the first user stories for you app up on your board in order for this to be approved. We recommend referencing the user stories provided in Quantified Self for great examples.
