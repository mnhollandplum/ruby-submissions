## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### 1. Project Planning & Management

Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)

- Meets Expectations - I used a waffle board and wireframe tool to plan out every feature and interfact before beginning work.

### 2. Completion & Pace

Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way. Developer communicates adjustments to Technical Lead as soon as possible (if necessary).

- Meets Expectations - While I did initially set out to add several features that never came to fruition,  I learned very much about rolling with the punches and adjusting goals.  Each day I would lay out certain features that would need to be accomplished by the end of the day and did my best to communicate those to the Tech lead during check ins.

### 3. Implementation Quality

Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions and best practices.

- Meets Expectations - Overall, the React App could be better organized, but is sufficiently well structured for it's purpose. The back end is well structured, organized, tested and refactored.

### 4. Application of Techniques

Developer implements four new techniques or patterns.

- Meets Expectations - Learned a TON about React, the NREL api, React graph rendering, and React Router

### 5. Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.

- Meets Expectations - The Readme is present and lays out a general overview of the application and it's usage.  Documentation has room for improvement.

### 6. Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.

- Below Expectations - My color choices were minimal and implemented high contrast where present.  Overall though, accessability wasn't a high priority in reaching the MVP.
