## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### Specification Adherence

Application implements **all** functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect.

- Above Expectations<br>
**- Meets Expectations** <br>
Functionality is there in every aspect, but we get one console error when deleting a food from the food table about also trying to patch. This error does not affect functionality in any way.
- Below Expectations

### Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application (for _both_ front-end and back-end repos).

- Above Expectations<br>
**- Meets Expectations**<br>
Descriptions, setup, how to contribute and links to the live versions/opposite frontend or backend are provided.
- Below Expectations

### HTML/UI

The team put some effort into styling, and the application is not confusing to use (including, but not limited to, user should **not** have to type anything into the URL to go between pages). HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.

- Above Expectations<br>
**- Meets Expectations**<br>
Navigation links exist to aid the user in navigating the site without typing into the URL bar. All HTML classes and IDs are kebab case and the site is clean and well styled without any accessibility errors.
- Below Expectations

### Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility (your app should have 0 violations according to aXe).

**- Meets Expectations**<br>
We have zero accessibility errors across all pages on both the frontend and backend sites (the backend site has a homepage expalining the endpoints).<br>
- Below Expectations

### JS syntax and Style

JavaScript code is logically divided into files. Developers can show examples of good coding practices and demonstrate OOP concepts, like DRY and separation of concerns. Developers pay attention to indentation and naming conventions. They also _consistently_ utilize ES5 or ES6 syntax and jQuery when working with events.

**- Above Expectations**<br>
We are using the MVC model for our express backend to organize files. We have a defined structure on the frontend to divide DOM manipulation, fetch functions, and event listeners. We combed through all of our code looking for areas to fix indentation. We use only ES6 on our frontend and only ES5 on our backend in order to get practice with both.<br>
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations

### Git Workflow

The team uses master for production, uses feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature with good context and conversation, following the template. Commit messages are in the present tense, and start with a capital letter. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.

- Above Expectations<br>
**- Meets Expectations**<br>
We are using master for production and created separate branches for each feature/group of cards with PRs for each one. We provided feedback and areas to focus on or keep track of going forward.
- Below Expectations

### Project Management

The team is using Pivotal Tracker to keep their project organized and to track progress. Team is documenting conclusions and timelines on relevant cards.

**- Above Expectations**<br>
We used Pivotal Tracker in real time to keep track of our progress through the user stories. In addition, we added small features and chores amongst the larger stories to stop the little things from slipping through.<br>
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations

### Communication

The team consistently reaches out to their Technical Lead for feedback on code quality and technical issues. The team responds to their Technical Lead in a timely manner. The team implements feedback from Technical Lead around pacing, refactors, workflow, etc.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations<br>
**- Below Expectations**<br>
We didn't reach out to our technical leader for feedback on code, but we did respond to any requests they had in a timely manner.
