### Option 4: Original Idea

**MEETS EXPECTATIONS**

That's right. You are creative and I believe in you. Feel free to pitch an original idea for the mini-project.

#### Must-Haves:

[X] Deploy to Heroku
[X] Authentication/Authorization
[X] One-to-many and Many-to-many relationships
[X] Styling

#### Approval

In order to have your project approved, send a slack message to your instructors with answers to the following questions:

[ ] What will a visitor be able to do?
[ ] What will a logged in user be able to do?
[ ] What will an admin be able to do?
[ ] What is a one-to-many relationship you will be using?
[ ] What is a many-to-many relationship you will be using?

#### Things to Consider

If you choose to do this option make sure you try to implement all the concepts we've touched over the last week. For example:

[X] TDD - model and feature tests
[X] CRUD
[X] 1-1 and 1-many relationships
[X] ReST-ful routes
[X] Well structured relational database design
[X] Rails helpers
[X] Sessions, flashes and maybe cookies if you have a good use case for them.
[X] Authentication
[X] Authorization
