### Option 4: Original Idea

**BELOW EXPECTATION**

Notes:

CRUD functionality was buggy. I could not create a player and was unable to delete as well.
When I was unable to create and delete there were no flash messages telling me that something had gone wrong or what had gone wrong. In another instance I had a flash message linger for far too long.


That's right. You are creative and I believe in you. Feel free to pitch an original idea for the mini-project.

#### Must-Haves:

[x] Deploy to Heroku
[X] Authentication/Authorization
[x] One-to-many and Many-to-many relationships
[x] Styling

#### Approval

In order to have your project approved, send a slack message to your instructors with answers to the following questions:

[x] What will a visitor be able to do?
[x] What will a logged in user be able to do?
[x] What will an admin be able to do?
[x] What is a one-to-many relationship you will be using?
[x] What is a many-to-many relationship you will be using?

#### Things to Consider

If you choose to do this option make sure you try to implement all the concepts we've touched over the last week. For example:

[x] TDD - model and feature tests
[ ] CRUD
[x] 1-1 and 1-many relationships
[x] ReST-ful routes
[x] Well structured relational database design
[x] Rails helpers
[ ] Sessions, flashes and maybe cookies if you have a good use case for them.
[x] Authentication
[x] Authorization
