Working through CLI for encrypt
Errors out for all other scenarios

There are a couple of long methods
Built out with fairly straightforward steps
Nice use of Classes and thinking through where methods should live

Method naming and most variable naming are communicative  

Tests cover all the methods present  

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

Expectations:

- [ ] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation

* 2: Below expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

Expectations:

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes

- [ ] Functionality is accurately covered
- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   
- [x] Balances unit and integration tests
- [x] Evidence of edge cases testing
- [ ] Test Coverage metrics are present (SimpleCov)

* 2: Below expectations

### 4. Functionality

Expectations:
