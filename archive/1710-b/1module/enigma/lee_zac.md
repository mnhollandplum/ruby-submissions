**Notes:**

* Great attention to detail on the spec!
* Focus on identifying repeated methods & extract them; also, refactor do blocks & variable assignments into separate methods (SRP)
* Make sure to include edge-case testing (and test for dynamic functionality, e.g. multiple input/output scenarios)


## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

Expectations: 

- [x] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
- [x] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- [x] Ruby methods used are logical and readable  
- [x] Developer implements appropriate enumerable methods (#each is used sparingly)
- [x] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line  

* 3: Meets expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

Expectations: 

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes 
- [x] Developer writes methods less than 8 lines 
- [x] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP 

* 3: Meets expectations


### 3. Test-Driven Development

Expectations: 

- [x] Each method is tested  
- [x] Functionality is accurately covered
- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   
- [x] Balances unit and integration tests 
- [ ] Evidence of edge cases testing 
- [x] Test Coverage metrics are present (SimpleCov)

* 2: Below expectations

### 4. Functionality

Expectations: 

- [x] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)

* 4: Above expectations
