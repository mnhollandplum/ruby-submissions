**Notes:**
* Encrypt finished and working
* Could use a bit more specificity in tests
* Be careful to name your tests to specify exactly what they are looking for
* Some major opportunities to refactor within code, look to avoid the pattern
of using loops to create a collection, use .map instead
* When nesting things that loop, pull out inner functionality to other methods
* A number of methods were too long and did too much
* Used a module! (Good)

* 2: Below expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

Expectations:

- [ ] Functionality is accurately covered
- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style
- [ ] Balances unit and integration tests
- [ ] Evidence of edge cases testing
- [ ] Test Coverage metrics are present (SimpleCov)

* 2: Below expectations

### 4. Functionality

Expectations:
