**Notes:**  
Works for one letter of encrypt
Test files for offset & key, but broken for test_helper  
Broken into offset, key, encrypt classes

Efforts towards putting functionality into methods  

Confusion around variables, saving instance to a local in the method  

Struggled with git/github, merging branches, two repos



## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

Expectations:

- [ ] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
- [ ] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [ ] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- [ ] Ruby methods used are logical and readable  
- [ ] Developer implements appropriate enumerable methods (#each is used sparingly)
- [x] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line  

* 1: Well-below expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

Expectations:

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [x] Developer writes methods less than 8 lines
- [x] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

* 3: Meets expectations

### 3. Test-Driven Development

Expectations:

- [ ] Each method is tested  
- [ ] Functionality is accurately covered
- [ ] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   
- [ ] Balances unit and integration tests
- [ ] Evidence of edge cases testing
- [ ] Test Coverage metrics are present (SimpleCov)

* 1: Well-below expectations

### 4. Functionality

Expectations:

- [ ] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)

* 1: Well-below expectations
