**Instructor:** Mike
**Repo URL:** https://github.com/Maxscores/enigma
**Notes:**
* Well tested, 100% coverage
* All functionality works
* Some repetition in code especially with the FileIO and the encrypt and
decrypt methods sharing a lot of similarity
* Would like to have seen more edge case testing in tests
* Some un idiomatic use of the times loop

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

Expectations:

- [x] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation
- [ ] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)

- [ ] Developer implements appropriate enumerable methods (#each is used sparingly)
- [x] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line

* 3: Meets expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

Expectations:

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [x] Developer writes methods less than 8 lines

* 3: Meets expectations

### 3. Test-Driven Development

Expectations:

- [x] Each method is tested
- [x] Functionality is accurately covered
- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style
- [x] Balances unit and integration tests
- [ ] Evidence of edge cases testing
- [x] Test Coverage metrics are present (SimpleCov)

* 3: Meets expectations

### 4. Functionality

Expectations:

- [x] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)


* 3: Meets expectations
