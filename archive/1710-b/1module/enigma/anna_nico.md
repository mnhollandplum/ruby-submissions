**Notes:**

* Great Ruby style & syntax!
* Make sure to read spec carefully & include classes that are instantiated & focus on using instance variables & attrs (also name things according to spec)
* Focus especially on TDD (more expansive tests & additional testing; also refrain from puts outcomes in your tests)
* Push yourselves to refactor (SRP means the method is solely responsible for the action it's completing)


## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

Expectations: 

- [x] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
- [x] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- [x] Ruby methods used are logical and readable  
- [x] Developer implements appropriate enumerable methods (#each is used sparingly)
- [x] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line  

* 3: Meets expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

Expectations: 

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes 
- [x] Developer writes methods less than 8 lines 
- [ ] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP 

* 2: Below expectations (high 2)


### 3. Test-Driven Development

Expectations: 

- [ ] Each method is tested  
- [ ] Functionality is accurately covered
- [ ] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   
- [ ] Balances unit and integration tests 
- [ ] Evidence of edge cases testing 
- [ ] Test Coverage metrics are present (SimpleCov)

* 2: Below expectations

### 4. Functionality

Expectations: 

- [ ] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)

* 2: Below expectations (didn't complete crack & didn't create Enigma class)
