**Notes:** 

* Be sure to name your files according to your classes & include a test directory (and run your tests from the project directory via `ruby test/node_test.rb`)
* Work on breaking logic out to improve SRP (any if/else statements, loops, variable assignment, etc.) & to improve workflow (break out tests)
* Be diligent in indenting properly & removing comments before pushing your final code
* Study your attribute encapsulation (make sure to identify & extract attr_reader methods)
