**Notes:** 

* Make sure to order tests with setup & assertions at bottom 
* Work on breaking logic out to improve SRP (any if/else statements, loops, variable assignment, etc.) & to improve workflow (break out tests)
* Pay attention to indentation & spacing
* Be sure to read the spec carefully & produce proper return values
* Gradually increase complexity of expectations in tests to ensure dynamic functionality (e.g. your `to_string` method) 

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

Expectations: 

- [ ] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  

- [x] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately

- [x] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)

- [x] Ruby methods used are logical and readable

- [ ] Code is indented properly

- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line  

* 2: Below expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

Expectations: 

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes 

- [x] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines 

- [x] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP 

* 3: Meets expectations

### 3. Test-Driven Development

Expectations: 

- [ ] Each method is tested  

- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   

* 2: Below expectations

### 4. Functionality

Expectations: 

- [ ] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)

* 2: Below expectations
