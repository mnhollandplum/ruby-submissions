**Instructor:** Victoria
**Repo URL:** https://github.com/kelleyjenkins/perilous_journey
**Notes:** 

* Shy away from using data types in naming
* Make sure tests are split into setup & assertions (break out extra tests if you need to assert in-between)
* Work on breaking logic out to improve SRP (any if/else statements, loops, variable assignment, etc.) & to improve workflow (break out tests)
* Clean up master from here on out (no comments or failing/errored tests)

* 2: Below expectations

### 3. Test-Driven Development

Expectations: 

- [x] Each method is tested
