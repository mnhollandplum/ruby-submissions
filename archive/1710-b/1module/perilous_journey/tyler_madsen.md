**Notes:** 

* Way to push for extensions!
* Critically think about what logic belongs where (hunting & supplies in WagonTrain)
* Work on breaking logic out to improve SRP (any if/else statements, loops, variable assignment, etc.) & to improve workflow (break out tests)
* Be sure to read the spec carefully & produce proper return values
