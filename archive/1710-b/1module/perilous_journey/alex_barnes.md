**Notes:** 

* Work on breaking logic out to improve SRP (any if/else statements, loops, variable assignment, etc.) & to improve workflow (break out tests)
* Pay close attention to spec (is original functionality still working properly (supplies default), what should be returned, what the method name should be, etc.)
* Pay close attention to indentation
* Make sure to break up tests into smaller pieces, especially when you have setup-assertions-setup-assertions 

## Evaluation Rubric

- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line  

* 2: Below expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

Expectations: 

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes 

- [x] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines 

- [ ] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP 

* 2: Below expectations

### 3. Test-Driven Development

Expectations: 

- [x] Each method is tested  

- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   

* 3: Meets expectations


### 4. Functionality
