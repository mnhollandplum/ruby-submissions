**Notes:** 

* Way to push for edge-case testing!
* Make sure your tests are all within a test directory (and run your tests from the project directory via `ruby test/node_test.rb`)
* Separate your setup and assertions
* Fix indentation on VSCode to be 2 spaces/tab
* Work on breaking logic out to improve SRP (any if/else statements, loops, variable assignment, etc.) & to improve workflow (break out tests)
* Push to use more Ruby methods & style (`while`/`until` loops instead of `for i`)

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

Expectations: 

- [x] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  

- [x] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately

- [x] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)

- [ ] Ruby methods used are logical and readable

- [x] Code is indented properly

- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line  

* 2: Below expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

Expectations: 

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes 

- [ ] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines 

- [ ] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP 

* 2: Below expectations

### 3. Test-Driven Development

Expectations: 

- [x] Each method is tested  

- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   

* 4: Above expectations

### 4. Functionality

Expectations: 

- [x] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)

* 3: Meets expectations
