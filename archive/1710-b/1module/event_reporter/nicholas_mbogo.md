* **Notes:**

* Way to push yourself to tackle this project on your own. Make sure you're still reaching out when you're really stuck. Good effort towards breaking the problem apart, but remember to leave time at the end of every 'iteration' to refactor. Also use that pause to bolster your test suite (and ensure you have all the pieces necessary according to the spec)
