* **Evaluator:** Victoria
* **Repo:** https://github.com/Heybluguy/event_reporter
* **Notes:**

* Focus on more expressive naming in both implementation code & testing (and make sure to include simplecov when required)
* Great effort toward refactoring, but continue to consider which methods belong in which classes

- [x] Developer implements best-choice enumerable methods
- [x] Code is indented properly

### 4. Functionality

Expectations: 

- [ ] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)

* 2: Below expectations


### 5. Version Control

- [x] Developer commits at a pace of at least 1 commit per hour
- [x] Developer implements branching and PRs
