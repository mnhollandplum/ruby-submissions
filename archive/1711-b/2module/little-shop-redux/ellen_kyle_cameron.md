* Exceeds Expectations: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions
* Meets Expectations: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented
**Below Expectations: There are one or two features missing or incorrectly implemented**

### 2. Views

* Exceeds Expectations: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present

* Meets Expectations: Project has a running test suite that tests at multiple levels
**Below Expectations: Project has sporadic use of tests**

### 6. Usability

**Meets Expectations: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready**

### 7. Workflow

* Exceeds Expectations: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.
**Meets Expectations: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.**
