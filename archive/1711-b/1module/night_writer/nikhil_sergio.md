**Notes:**

* Make sure to read the project spec carefully & adhere to the input/output as defined
* Great job testing! That will really help with your refactoring
* Look up the methods represented by attr_readers & attr_accessors. Become familiar with which to use when (be aware of the vulnerabilities created with each)
* Practice your enums & become comfortable with both how to use them & when to use each
