**Notes:** 

* Focus on proper indentation- that will help a lot with identifying where you can refactor- definitely bring this kind of work to indiv check-ins, mentors & upper-mod pairing sessions
* Look deeper into attr_readers v. attr_accessors -  what they really represent and why we would use one over the other
* Great job following the spec carefully! (just one small discrepancy for jb.append returning array instead of string)
* Push to add tests for dynamic functionality & edge cases
