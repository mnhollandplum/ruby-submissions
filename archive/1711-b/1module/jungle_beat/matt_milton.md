**Notes:** 

* Look into attr_readers & attr_accessors- what they really represent and why we would use one over the other
* Great job breaking logic out; continue to identify further ways to extract methods & eventually classes as well
* Push to add tests for dynamic functionality & edge cases

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

Expectations: 

- [ ] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation

- [x] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- [x] Ruby methods used are logical and readable
- [x] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line  

* 3: Meets expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

Expectations: 

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes 
- [x] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines 
- [x] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP 

* 3: Meets expectations

### 3. Test-Driven Development

Expectations: 

- [x] Each method is tested  
- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   

* 3: Meets expectations

### 4. Functionality

Expectations: 

- [x] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)

* 3: Meets expectations
