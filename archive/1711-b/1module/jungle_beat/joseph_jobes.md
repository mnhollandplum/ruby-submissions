**Notes:** 

* Be aware of spacing
* Look a little deeper into attr_readers v. attr_accessors
* Continue to extract methods to adhere to SRP (single-responsibility principle); this will probably help DRY out your code
* Pay careful attention to the spec for what should be returned
* Push to add tests for dynamic functionality & edge cases

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

- [x] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line  

* 2: Below expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

Expectations: 

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes 
- [x] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines 
- [x] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP 

* 3: Meets expectations

### 3. Test-Driven Development

Expectations: 

- [x] Each method is tested  
- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   

* 3: Meets expectations

### 4. Functionality

Expectations: 

- [x] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)
