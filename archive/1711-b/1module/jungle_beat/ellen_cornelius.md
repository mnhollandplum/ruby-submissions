**Repo URL:** https://github.com/corneliusellen/JungleBeatProject.git
**Notes:** 

* Make sure to pay attention to indentation
* Push to add tests for dynamic functionality & edge cases
* Work to break out any functionality that violates SRP (single responsibility principle); this will help lead to DRYer code
