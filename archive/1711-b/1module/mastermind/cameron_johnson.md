Notes:

* Lots of repetition in three mode files
* Would like to have seen enumerables used to determine position matches
* Would like to have seen printed to screen messages pulled out to its own
module/class/something
* Good use of modules to handle stuff that has no state
* Would like to have seen the guess checking stuff pulled out to another object.
* Some opportunities to refactor



The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations

* 3: Meets expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

Expectations:

- [] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
- [x] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

* 2: Below expectations

### 3. Test-Driven Development

Expectations:
