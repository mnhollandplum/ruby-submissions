Notes:
* Node tests do not work
* Bst tests have four skipped tests (were for non working functionality)
* Used iterative approach throughout project
* Sort and health do not work
* Tests did check both sides of methods, but need to be more granular

Rubric:

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

[ ] 4: Above expectations
[ ] 3: Meets expectations
[ ] 2: Below expectations
[ ] 1: Well-below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

[x] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
[x] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
[x] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
[ ] Ruby methods used are logical and readable
[x] Code is indented properly
[x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
[x] Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories

[ ] 4: Above expectations
[x] 3: Meets expectations
[ ] 2: Below expectations
[ ] 1: Well-below expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

[ ] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes 
[x] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines 
[ ] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP 

[ ] 4: Above expectations
[X] 3: Meets expectations
[ ] 2: Below expectations
[ ] 1: Well-below expectations

### 3. Test-Driven Development

[x] Each method is tested  
[ ] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   

[ ] 4: Above expectations
[ ] 3: Meets expectations
[x] 2: Below expectations
[ ] 1: Well-below expectations

### 4. Functionality

[ ] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)

[ ] 4: Above expectations
[ ] 3: Meets expectations
[ ] 2: Below expectations
[x] 1: Well-below expectations
