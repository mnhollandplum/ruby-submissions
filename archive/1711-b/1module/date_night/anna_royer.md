Notes:
* 19 tests, all passing
* Really great breaking out of methods in Node
* Node methods are all really clean and well refactored
* Some functionality in BST could be pushed down to Node
* Would like to have seen a bit more edge case testing in tests


Rubric:

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 3. Test-Driven Development

[x] Each method is tested  
[x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   

[ ] 4: Above expectations
[x] 3: Meets expectations
