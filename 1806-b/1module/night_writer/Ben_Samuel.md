## Functionality: 3

Notes:

- [x] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics: 3

Notes:

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design: 3

Notes:

* Try to follow SRP on a line by line basis
* Work on your naming
* Any time you have methods that look exactly the same except for one piece of data, that data can be passed in as an argument
* You could refactor file I/O into another class
* Try to include some sort of high level, user facing method, i.e. `translate`. Avoid the treasure map style of design. Also makes everything easier to test
* Your file names and class names are mismatched

The student(s):

- [ ] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [ ] utilizes Test Driven Development to drive the design of the code.
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [ ] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing: 3

Notes:

* Missing test for breaking up by 40 lines

The student(s):

- [ ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program
- [ ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [x] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [x] translates technical specifications into tests
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control: 3

Notes:

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [x] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [x] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
