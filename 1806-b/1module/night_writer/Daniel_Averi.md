## Functionality: 3

Notes:

- [x] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics: 3

Notes:

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design: 3

Notes:

* Don't name variables just the data type
* Really like the high level translate method!
* If you have repeated code with only one small difference, make that a variable and pass it in as an argument.

The student(s):

- [ ] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [ ] utilizes Test Driven Development to drive the design of the code.
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing: 3

Notes:

* missing test for lines longer than 40 characters
* instead of using other methods to create input for your tests, just literally type the input
* You can put the high level method at the top of the test file. Just a suggestion!

The student(s):

- [ ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program
- [x] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [x] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [x] translates technical specifications into tests
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [x] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control

Notes:

The student(s):

- [ ] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [ ] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [ ] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
