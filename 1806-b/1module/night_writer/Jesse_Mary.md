## Functionality: 3

Notes:

- [x] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics: 3

Notes:

* Keep an eye on .map and .each - make sure that you are using the proper syntax for the enum that you choose.

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design: 3

Notes:

The student(s):

- [x] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [x] utilizes Test Driven Development to drive the design of the code.
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing: 3

Notes:

* I would have like to see a test that was testing the translation of `hello world`
* Think about just expanding the test suite

The student(s):

- [x] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program
- [x] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [x] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [x] translates technical specifications into tests
- [x] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control: 3

Notes:

* Try to make some more commits
* Include comments on all Pull Requests

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [x] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [x] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
