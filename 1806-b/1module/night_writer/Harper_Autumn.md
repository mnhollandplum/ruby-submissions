## Functionality: 3

Notes:

* Writing doesn't put the correct number of characters.

- [x] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics: 3

Notes:

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design

Notes:

* really like the high level method. It is very readable
* Good use of comments
* In general, try to limit use of instance variables when you can

The student(s):

- [x] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [x] utilizes Test Driven Development to drive the design of the code.
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [ ] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing: 3

Notes:

* You can put your high level method at the beginning of the test file
* Missing tests for lines longer than 40/80 characters

The student(s):

- [ ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program
- [ ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [x] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [x] translates technical specifications into tests
- [x] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control: 3

Notes:

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [x] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [x] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
