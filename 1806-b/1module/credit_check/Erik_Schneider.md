## Functionality

Notes:

* No readme


- [x] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics

Notes:

* Some unnecessary local variable use could be avoided with better choice
enumerables

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [ ] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design

Notes:
* Project uses the treasure map approach.
* There are methods which are not DRY

The student(s):

- [ ] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [ ] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * **Variable and method names are self explanatory**
    * **Methods are under 7 lines**
    * **Lines of code are under 80 characters**
    * **Project directory structure adheres to convention**
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing

Notes:
* Unnecessary whitespace in tests
* One of the test values for a properly working creditcard number is 80

The student(s):

- [ ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [x] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [x] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [x] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [x] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control

Notes:

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [x] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [x] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
