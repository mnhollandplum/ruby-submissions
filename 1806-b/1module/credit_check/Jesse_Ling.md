## Functionality: 4

Notes:

* Good job reaching for those extensions!

- [x] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics: 3

Notes:

* Everything here looks very clean.
* Really like your `luhn_algorithm` method.
* Really like that you're reusing code in your `get_check_digit` method.

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design: 3

Notes:

* No need for an initialize! Doesn't appear that you're doing anything with the instance variable. This is a rare case where you don't necessarily need to hold any state in your class.
* Really like that you split the interface out into a separate class. Shows that you're really thinking about Single Responsibility.

The student(s):

- [x] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing: 3

Notes:

* Looks good! Tests are very easy to read and seem to be testing all the right things.

The student(s):

- [x] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [x] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [x] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [x] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [x] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control: 3

Notes:

* Really like the number of commits!
* Like that you have a pull request. Could potentially have more.

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [x] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [x] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
