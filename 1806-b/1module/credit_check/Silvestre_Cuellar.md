## Functionality: 2

Notes: The logic and algorithm are really on track and would be a 3 if you take into account passing in the credit card number as an integer and included tests. This is on the right track.

- [ ] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics: 3

Notes: In general, the code looks really clean - great job!  I would encourage you to think about when an initialize method is necessary; it seems like in this case, you could have left it out.  Also, just a small thing, watch the number of lines you leave between methods; we typically see just one line in between methods.

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design: 3

Notes: The code design looks good - one thing that I would recommend is to rearrange your methods so that the higher-level operations, like `valid_number?` are at the top of the class, rather than the bottom.

The student(s):

- [x] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing: 1

Notes: It looks like your test file is just a copy of your credit_check.rb file?  The test file should hold a Minitest testing suite!

The student(s):

- [ ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [ ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [ ] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control: 1

Notes: I think you had some struggle with git/GitHub; don't let this get you down, you will keep getting more comfortable as the mod progresses!

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [ ] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [ ] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
