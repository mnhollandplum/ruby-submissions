## Functionality: 2

Notes:

* The algorithm looks great, and I love that it is on gitHub!

- [ ] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics: 2

Notes:

* I really appreciate the work that you put into trying to create a class!  I think one thing that might help you is to remember that a class does not have to 'do anything' when it is first created.  What we really want is a class object that knows 'how' to do things, and then only does anything when we tell it to.

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [ ] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [ ] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design: 2

Notes:

* From the work that you have done on creating a class, it looks like you have a good understanding of how methods should be broken up, now its just the final hurdle of making them work together!

The student(s):

- [ ] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [ ] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [ ] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing: 1

Notes:

The student(s):

- [ ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [ ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [ ] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control: 2

Notes:

* Try to make smaller, more frequent commits!
* For the next project, really focus on branching and pull requests.


The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [x] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [ ] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
