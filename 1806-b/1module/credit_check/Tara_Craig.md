## Functionality: 4

Notes: Looks awesome!

- [x] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics: 3

Notes: Code is really clean, the only (super small) thing that I think you should think about is the conditional that you have on line 75 of credit_check.rb; because `validity` returns a boolean value, you could replace what you have with `if validity`.

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design: 3

Notes: Looks great; I especially like the order your methods are in - very readable.

The student(s):

- [x] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing: 3

Notes: Your test suite looks really good - I think the next step would be to include some edge case testing. For example, what happens if someone tries to validate a credit_card number that is too short, or too long?

The student(s):

- [x] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [x] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [x] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [x] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control: 3

Notes: Great version control.  I really like seeing multiple pull requests!  I think the next level up would be to include more detail in your PR comments.

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [x] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [x] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
