## Functionality: 3

Notes:

- [x] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics: 3

Notes:

* This looks great!
* Just remember that the boolean value `true` is not equal to the string value `"true"`!
* Keep an eye on the instance variables that you are creating - if you are not using them, they don't need to be created.

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design: 3

Notes:

* You should not have executable code in your credit check file, outside of the class (in 'credit_check2_2' see lines 60 - 78)
* Think about the order of your methods within the class; it would have been nice to see the `valid_number?` and `validation_output` methods near the top of the class.

The student(s):

- [x] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing: 3

Notes:

* These tests are really good!
* As you think about writing tests in the future, I would encourage you to use the information given in the project spec as your test data.

The student(s):

- [x] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [x] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [x] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [x] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [x] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control: 3

Notes:

* Great job with the pull request!
* For future projects, we would like to see branches that reflect the different 'versions' of your class files, instead of class1_1, class1_2, etc...

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [x] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [x] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
