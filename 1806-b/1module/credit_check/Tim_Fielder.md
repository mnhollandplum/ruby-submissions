## Functionality: 3

Notes: Looks good!

- [x] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics: 3

Notes: This looks really great!  The only thing that I want to point out is that your initialize method is not doing much in this case - in the future I would encourage you to think about when and initialize method is necessary and when you can get away with not having it.

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design: 3

Notes: I love the comments that you have within the class and the Luhn algorithm broken out below - keep it up!  The only thing to keep in mind, that we usually see methods like `valid_number?` and `algorithm` near the top of the class - not a big deal, just a convention.

The student(s):

- [x] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing: 2

Notes: The structure of this file looks good, but we do want to see all these tests created.  Keep going in this same direction, just show us some tests next time!

The student(s):

- [ ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [x] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [ ] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control: 2

Notes: This is so close to a three!  We do want to see smaller, more frequent commits.  Awesome job getting the PR done successfully!

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [ ] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [x] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
