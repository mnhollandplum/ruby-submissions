## Functionality

Notes:

- [x] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics

Notes:


The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [ ] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design

Notes:

* There's a method, `calculate_check_sum_digit` which repeats a lot that was in a
previous method.
* There a few instances where a better enumerable choice would have eliminated
the need for a local variable.


The student(s):

- [ ] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [ ] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * **Variable and method names are self explanatory**
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * **Lines of code are under 80 characters**
    * **Project directory structure adheres to convention**
    * **A linter reports less than 5 errors**

## Testing

Notes:

 * `test_it_can_validate_a_card_number` isnt clear in what is happeing
 * Remove commented out skips before submissions

The student(s):

- [x] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [ ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [x] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [x] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [x] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control

Notes:

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [x] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [x] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
