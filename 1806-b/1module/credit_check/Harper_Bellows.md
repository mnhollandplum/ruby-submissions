## Functionality: 4

Notes:

* Really like that you reached for those extentions!

- [x] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics: 3

Notes:

* This code looks great! I really like how clean this is!
* Really like your `check_sum_digit` method!

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design

* Really like the way yo're using `valid_number?` in your `validation_output` method!
* This sounds silly, but like that `validation_output` and `valid_number?` are the first two methods in your class. Those are the methods that I'm planning on using from outside the class, and that organization tells/is consistent with that story.
* `calculate_check_sum_digit`! Like that you reached for this and really like that you're reusing the code that you already created!

Notes:

The student(s):

- [x] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing: 3: 3: 3: 3

Notes:

* Tests look good!
* Like the balance of integration and feature tests!

The student(s):

- [x] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [x] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [x] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [x] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [x] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control: 3

Notes:

* Really like the number of commits and pull requests!

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [x] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [x] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
