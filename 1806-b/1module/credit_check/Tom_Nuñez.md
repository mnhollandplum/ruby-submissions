## Functionality: 1

Notes: The algorithm looks really good.  I think you are definitely on the right track, logically, but need to see this wrapped in a class.

- [ ] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics: 2

Notes: Again, your logic is spot on. My biggest note here is that you should have different pieces of the logic broken into classes.  For example, the

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [ ] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [ ] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design: 1

Notes: In addition to the class and method stuff mentioned above, remember to name your variables something descriptive.  You generally do not see array# as a variable name.

The student(s):

- [ ] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [ ] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [ ] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing: 1

Notes: The file structure looks good, but we need to see tests!  I think that writing tests will also help you group your code into methods - the idea being you will (at a minimum) write a test for each method in your class.

The student(s):

- [ ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [ ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [ ] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control: 1

Notes: Try to make smaller, more frequent commits and we do want you to use pull requests.

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [ ] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [ ] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
