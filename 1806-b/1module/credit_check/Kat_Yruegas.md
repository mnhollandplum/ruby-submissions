## Functionality: 4

Notes:

* Good job tackling the AmEx numbers!

- [x] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics: 3

Notes:

* Generally looks good!

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design: 3

Notes:

* Love the way you've organized your `valid_number?` method. Really seem to get the idea of abstraction.
* Also like the way you organized your `validation_output` method and put `validity` out to its own method.
* Think that there could be some improvement of your `single_digits` method (maybe splitting some of the logic in 46 - 49 into a separate method), but *really* like how clear the logic is.

The student(s):

- [x] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing: 3

Notes:

* Generally down the right path.
* Would've liked to see those commented out tests implemented.
* Would probably recommend that you don't merge commented out code. Probably fine on a work-in-progress branch. But wouldn't let it get to master.

The student(s):

- [x] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [x] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [x] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [x] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [x] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control: 3

Notes:

* Like your use of pull requests and the number of commits!

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [x] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [x] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
