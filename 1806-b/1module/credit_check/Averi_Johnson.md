## Functionality: 2

Notes:

* Looks like you were really close!

- [ ] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics: 3

Notes:

* Generally moving in the right direction!
* See comment below about instance variables!

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [ ] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design: 3

Notes:

* Like the way you're writing your methods!
* Like how you're thinking through things.
* Think that you have some good logic here.
* *Main Comment:* Recommend that you switch to using return values instead of instance variables. Reserve instance variables for those things that feel like the *state* of the object you're dealing with. Use return values when you just need to move information around.

The student(s):

- [x] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [ ] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing: 2

Notes:

* Seems to be moving down the right path!
* Think you could have some more tests, but you are definitely doing the right thing. Just a little more of it!

The student(s):

- [x] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [x] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [x] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control: 2

Notes:

* For next project see if you can add some commits/pull requests!

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [ ] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [ ] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
