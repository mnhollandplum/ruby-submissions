Notes:

* Generally looks like you're on the right path!
* Three things would have made it so that you had 3's across the board:
    * Pull request from a branch merged into your master branch on GitHub
    * Using return values in your `credit_check` method. This is the main thing I would focus on! I think you're right that this would eventually turn into your `valid_number?` method later.
    * Adding more tests. Ideally would have a single test for each of the methods in your CreditCheck class. I'm not positive, but it might be the case that you were focused on functionality? I think this score would probably rise if you had some additional time. Might also benefit from the return values adjustment mentioned above.

## Functionality: 2

Notes:

There is a lot of good stuff going on here:

* *Really* like your pseudocode.
* Like the organization of your thinking.

- [ ] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics: 3

Notes:

* Again, think the thing that hurt you most here was the lack of a class/methods. With that fix, this likely would be a 3.

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design: 3

Notes:

The student(s):

- [x] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing: 2

Notes:

* On the right track with testing!
* Would like to see tests for each of the methods in the CreditCheck file.

The student(s):

- [x] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [ ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [x] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control: 2

Notes:

* Like the number of commits you had!
* Would need to have a branch/merge to get up to a 3.

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [x] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [ ] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
