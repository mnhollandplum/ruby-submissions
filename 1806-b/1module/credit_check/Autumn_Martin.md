## Functionality: 1

Notes:

There is a lot of good stuff going on here:

* *Really* like your pseudocode.
* Like the organization of your thinking.

Unfortunately, putting things in a class was part of the second iteration, so following the rubric means that this is a 1 on functionality. Don't get discouraged!

- [ ] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics: 2

Notes:

* Again, think the thing that hurt you most here was the lack of a class/methods. With that fix, this likely would be a 3.

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [ ] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [ ] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design: 1

Notes:

The student(s):

- [ ] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [ ] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [ ] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [ ] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing: 1

Notes:

* Would really like to see testing!

The student(s):

- [ ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [ ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [ ] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control: 2

Notes:

* Like the number of commits you had!
* Would need to have a branch/merge to get up to a 3.

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [x] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [ ] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
