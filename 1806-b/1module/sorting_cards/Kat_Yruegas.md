## Functionality - 3

Notes:
- Great work, Kat!

- [X] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics - 3

Notes:
- Don't forget all the _awesome_ enumerables that Ruby gives us! The make your life easier and improves readability for other devs reading your code!

The student(s):

- [X] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [ ] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [X] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [X] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [X] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design - 2.5

Notes:
- Indentation was consistent and looked great!
- Watch your use of white space - usually want one space between methods/attr_readers, and no spaces at top of file.

The student(s):

- [X] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [X] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [X] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [X] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing - 3

Notes:
- A lot of great tests, way to start implementing the expected/actual pattern!
- Remember your test suite is a roadmap! Make sure your tests names describe to another dev what they expect to see in each method, and the order flows just like the program does!

The student(s):

- [X] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [ ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [X] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [X] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [X] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control - 3

Notes:
- Great number of commits, messages were clear and format was msotly consistent!

The student(s):

- [X] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [X] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [X] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
