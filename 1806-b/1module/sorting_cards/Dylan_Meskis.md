## Functionality: 1

Notes:

- [ ] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics: 3

Notes:

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design: 3

Notes:

* Don't use instance variables if you don't need to
* If something can be calculated easily, it doesn't need to be an instance variable

The student(s):

- [x] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [ ] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing: 2

Notes:

* Every test needs an assertion
* You need to test every path. If a method can return two different things, test both.
* Every test needs to start with test_

The student(s):

- [ ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [ ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [ ] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control: 2

Notes:

* Need more commits
* Need more PRs

The student(s):

- [ ] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [ ] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [ ] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
