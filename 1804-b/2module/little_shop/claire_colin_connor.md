## Evaluation Process

For the evaluation we'll work through the project expectations and look at the following criteria:


### 1. Feature Completeness

* Meets Expectations: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented

### 2. Views

* Meets Expectations: Views make use of layout(s)

### 3. Controller

* Meets Expectations: Controller is generally well organized with three or fewer methods needing refactoring

### 4. Models

* Meets Expectations: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring

### 5. ActiveRecord

* Meets Expectations: ActiveRecord is utilized wherever it can be. There is no Ruby where there should be ActiveRecord

### 6. Testing

* Meets Expectations: Project has a running test suite that tests at multiple levels

### 7. Usability

* Meets Expectations: Project is usable, but needs more polish or navigation before it'd be customer-ready

### 8. Workflow

* Meets Expectations: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.
