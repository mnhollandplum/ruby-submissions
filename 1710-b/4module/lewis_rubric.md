## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### 1. Project Planning & Management

Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)


- Meets Expectations

I used pivotal tracker to always plan the user stories that I was going to approach and moved them over when completed. I also did some early UI work on UX pin to produce low fidelity wireframes of how the app should look. This proved useful when creating a lean design that was easy to navigate. I was always sure to check out different feature branches especially when diving into a new piece of technology as I wanted to tread carefully. Commits were descriptive and frequent. 


### 2. Completion & Pace

Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way. Developer communicates adjustments to Technical Lead as soon as possible (if necessary).


- Meets Expectations

I felt that the stories I commited to in the initial plan were completed. I always communicated when I had issues i.e. with Facbook birthday data to dog years and proposed ways to work aroun this. There were some hickups with progress due to the current legal lockdown surrounding facebook, making some of their API endpoints go out of service. But I was able to work around these issues and gradually these endpoints seem to be coming back into service. 


### 3. Implementation Quality

Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions and best practices.


- Below Expectations

Code was broken down to different components and the different screens using React navigation so I was pleased with this aspect. I also made use of lots of ES6 syntatic sugar which made things cleaner and more readable. I do however feel that testing was not prioritized and was mainly done using the simulator. It would have been great to have more time to build feature tests using Jest and Enszyme. Will look to implement this in the next itteration. 


### 4. Application of Techniques

Developer implements four new techniques or patterns.

- Meets Expectations

Lots of new technology used and libraries. React Native, Exp, Firebase, Gifted Chat, Lodash, Geofire. So was pleased with this. Would be interested to see what it would be like to build something like this in swift. 


### 5. Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.


- Meets Expectations
Documentation shows clear set up instructions and also has badges. Slighlty annoying that users need to download expo to get the application running but because of the strict control of the IOS ecosystem this seems to be the easiest way to go about this.


### 6. Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.

- Meets Expectations
Without Axe it was harder to test for accessibility considerations. I however made every effort to make the UI as clean as possible, avoided colors that lack contrast to reduce issues for color blindness. Also the control on the cards, causing a user to have to slide past a certain breakpoint before a profile is liked reduces any accidental interaction for those with motor disabilites.
