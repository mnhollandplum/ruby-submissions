## Evaluation Process

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the following criteria:

- Instructor: Ian
- Heroku app: https://thawing-peak-97979.herokuapp.com/
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/JudsonStevens/bike_share

### Notes:

- 96.85% LOC test coverage
- some repetition in code where helpers and css styles would have reduced duplication
- models are really good, could have more optimal AR
- one controller had 19 AR calls

### Team Notes:

- more AR, more slim
- better join of the two halves of the project


1. Feature Completeness

* Meets Expectations: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented and project is deployed

2. Views

* Meets Expectations: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers

3. Controllers

* Meets Expectations: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer methods that need refactoring

4. Models

* Meets Expectations: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring

5. ActiveRecord

* Meets Expectations: ActiveRecord is utilized wherever it can be. There is no Ruby where there should be ActiveRecord

6. Testing

* Meets Expectations: Project has a running test suite that covers all functionality and tests at multiple levels

7. Usability

* Meets Expectations: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready

8. SASS

* Meets Expectations: Project utilizes SASS but does not harness its unique functionality

8. Workflow

* Meets Expectations: Good use of branches, pull requests, peer and instructor code review, rebasing, and a project-management tool.

9. Documentation

* Exceeds Expectations: Excellent README which gives users an exemplary guide to the what and how your application
