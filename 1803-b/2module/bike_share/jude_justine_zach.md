## Evaluation Process

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the following criteria:

- Instructor: Ian
- Heroku app: https://guarded-ravine-88112.herokuapp.com/
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/jude-lawson/bike-share

### Notes:

- 97.63% LOD test coverage
- handful of places where Ruby was used where AR could have been used, or mixing Ruby and AR together
- one dashboard controller makes 11 AR calls
- lots of sad path code but missing some sad path tests are missing

### Team Notes:

- a lot to the project
- lots of deadlines
- no shame in what I built


1. Feature Completeness

* Meets Expectations: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented and project is deployed

2. Views

* Meets Expectations: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers

3. Controllers

7. Usability

8. Workflow

* Meets Expectations: Good use of branches, pull requests, peer and instructor code review, rebasing, and a project-management tool.
